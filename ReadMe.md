## Project Desciption
*Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
### Project Setup Instructions
*For this week's Independent Project, I am required to build a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

* As a user, I would like to;

    1. See a  small description of what the application does on the landing page.
    2. Enter my birthday through a form 
    3. Choose what gender I am.
    4. Click the submit button to see what my Akan name would be
